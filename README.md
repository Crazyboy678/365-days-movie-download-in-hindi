*365 Days* is a Polish erotic thriller film directed by Barbara Białowąs and Tomasz Mandes. It revolves around Laura Biel, a young woman from Poland, who finds herself caught in a high-stakes world of luxury, power, and danger when she is kidnapped by Massimo Torricelli, a powerful mafia boss. Massimo is fixated on Laura after a violent encounter years prior and gives her an ultimatum: spend 365 days with him, during which she must either fall in love with him or face the consequences. 

The film takes place in the idyllic coastal regions of Italy, where the beautiful setting serves as a contrast to the dark, dangerous undertones of the mafia world. Massimo, portrayed by Michele Morrone, is a character that commands both fear and attraction, while Laura, played by Anna-Maria Sieklucka, initially resists his advances but gradually begins to develop complex feelings toward him. 

The Mo𝚟ie follows Laura’s internal and external struggles as she navigates her captivity, complicated emotions, and the constant battle between love and freedom. The tension between desire and consent is a central theme, which sparked controversy upon its release, with many criticizing the film for its portrayal of Stockholm Syndrome and its glorification of toxic relationships.
